const text = `Hello, my name is Alfio and I am from Ischia an island in the South of Italy.

I've studied a bit of everything in high school, then did 2 years of engineering, but dropped without getting a degree. After that I tried to work as a mechanic, but turns out I'm really bad at it ðŸ˜‚ So, by the end of 2016 I left my hometown and came to London. In London I've been a KP, then a customer assistant at Primark. Life here is totally different from what I was used to, both in a good and in a bad way.
The best thing about London is that it is full of many different people and cultures and ways of thinking. And it has everything. Whatever you want to try you can try. Life here can be tough, but you have the chance to realize your projects and dreams.

This is also when I started learning about computer programming. The beginning was quite slow. I used to read about HTML and CSS, but it was just a side-activity. A few months in though, I found myself spending more and more time into it. Through coding it is possible to create things out of nothing, to turn an idea into something that actually works.

I really fell in love with computer programming when i realized that everything you can imagine, you can make a program for it.

And among all the beautiful things one can do with computer programming, I chose Web development because of its wide range. Through the Web you can reach anyone, anywhere. Imagine something you built, impacting the life of people both next-door and an ocean of distance from you. I think that sounds amazing.`;
